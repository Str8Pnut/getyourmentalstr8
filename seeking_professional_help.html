      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Effects of Neglecting Self-Care</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">When you don’t take care of yourself—physically, mentally, or emotionally—it can lead to serious consequences. You might feel more anxious, overwhelmed, or exhausted. Long-term neglect can weaken your immune system, disrupt sleep, and contribute to mental health issues like depression or burnout.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Physically, you may experience chronic fatigue, headaches, or a greater risk of illness. Emotionally, unchecked stress can lead to irritability, mood swings, or difficulty maintaining relationships. Mentally, it can impair your ability to focus, make decisions, or feel motivated.</p>
      <p>Taking small steps every day to care for yourself helps build resilience and can prevent long-term damage. It’s a sign of strength, not weakness, to pause and give yourself the care you deserve.</p>
