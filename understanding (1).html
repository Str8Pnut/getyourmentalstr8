      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">What is Mental Health?</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">Mental health is how your brain and heart feel. It's about your feelings, your thoughts, and how you act. Good mental health helps you feel happy, make friends, and stay calm when things get hard. It's like taking care of your mind, just like you take care of your body by eating and sleeping.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Why It Matters</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">When your mental health is good, you feel better inside. You can play, learn, and talk with people in a nice way. But when your mental health is not good, you may feel sad, mad, or scared. That’s why it’s important to talk about your feelings and ask for help when you need it. Everyone has feelings, and it's okay to talk about them.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">How Mental Health Can Change Over Time</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Just like people grow and change, your mental health can grow too. As you get older, you learn new ways to handle big feelings. You learn how to calm down, how to talk about what's wrong, and how to feel better after hard times. Sometimes life brings stress, sadness, or surprises, but you can get stronger each time. Getting help, talking to someone you trust, and learning how to care for your mind helps your mental health grow healthy and strong—just like a plant needs sun and water to grow big and bright.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li><strong>Childhood:</strong> You may learn to share, talk about your feelings, and get comfort from caregivers or teachers.</li>
        <li><strong>Teenage years:</strong> You may feel more pressure or emotions, but also start building your own ways to cope—like journaling, playing sports, or talking to a friend.</li>
        <li><strong>Adulthood:</strong> Life may bring more challenges like work or family responsibilities, but you also gain tools like therapy, self-care routines, or mindfulness to manage your well-being.</li>
